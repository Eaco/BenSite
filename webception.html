			Being a full time student in software engineering, it's not easy to get time off, to work on things that you personally want to work on. Because of this it can be hard to finish a project you've started on your own, especially if the project takes a little while. I learned the basics of html and css in an afternoon, thanks to <a href="http://www.codeacademy.com">codeacademy</a> which I must say is an extremely good tool! After learning the basics I started to mess around with the code, got to learn a few things from experiments, after which I started to plan out how I wanted the finished product to look, and how it should be structured. With the help of my good friend google it took me a couple of days to have it looking acceptable, after which I populated the pages (another couple of days) and now you are looking at the finished product!<br>
			My future plans for the website is to optimize it for different screen sizes, perhaps make a mobile version (just for fun) and finaly, once I get bored of the layout, totally redesign it and start over from square one.<br>
			Thanks for visiting!<br>
