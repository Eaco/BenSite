			Luribox UF was a company founded by myself and seven other highschool students in my hometown in Sweden. We designed and created headphone holders out of a plastic we purchased from the local steel mill, and engraved different logos and pictures into them as requested by our customers. One of our biggest customers at the time was Brynas IF, a professional swedish hockey team that went on to win the swedish series that year, resulting in good sales for them. We engraved the team's logo onto the holders (as can be seen in the pictures) using autocad and CNC machines.<br>
			The company has since been shut down, though we managed to make a humble profit on our endeavors.
