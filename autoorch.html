			The automated orchestra was a project started in 2012 by me and two classmates, Jonathan Sjolund and Partric Hardig, at Goranssosnka skolan, where we all studied at the time. It was a so called "creative Project" where we were given full freedom to build what we wanted, so long as it implemented a PLC controller and basic circuitry knowledge.<br>
			The so called "Automated Orchestra" was designed as a machine that could play many instruments at once, and by the end of the project time, we had implemented three instruments that could be played, a drum, a xylophone, and a sythisiser. The user could play all of these instruments manually, or could choose for the robot to play pre-programmed songs.<br>
			The robot itself was created using a siemens PLC, an industrial style siemens touchscreen, and an Arduino chip. Me and Jonathan were the lead programmers on the project, while Patric was in charge of the circuitry and design of the robot.<br>
			The result of our work was one of the most complicated machines to come out of our class, and a very well functioning machine. We even had time to implement some fun mechanics to the machine, as can be seen in one of the videos below.
