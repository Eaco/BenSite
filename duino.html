			Arduino "Hacking" has been a big part of my extracurricular technical experience ever since I first started learning to code and wire machines. I've been making gizmos on my spare time since the beginning of highschool, and my experience working with the open source hardware has come in handy many times since. A good case is the automated orchestra, where the PLC didn't have the logic flexability we wanted, so we ended up using one of my Arduino Uno chips to dictate the timing of the songs.<br>
			Though I've only been a hobbiest hardware hacker, I've been doing it for a long time, and it has really helped me understand the hardware side of industries, always trying to optimise for time and cost efficiency, and I couldn't reccomend it more to any software engineer, or in fact anyone at all who wants a good hobby that has many applications in the real world.
