		To start with, I was born in Wichita Kansas, and moved to Canada with my parents when I was very young. I lived in Canada until I was eight years old, when I moved to Sweden. In Sweden I studied at the international english school in Gavle, and later at Goranssonska technical institute. <br>
		I began programming in my early highschool years, starting out with C++, but moving over to C# once I got the hang of programming concepts. I spent most of my coding time making little games for myself with XNA, but never got around to polishing any of them enough for a real release. Since then I've had codeing projects in C++, C#, Java, Python, C, and most recently, html and CSS. <br>
